            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Oh hey, it's Zach.  I do the coding and the teamworking.  I enjoy both.</p>
            <p>
                <br />Welcome to my website!  My name is Zachary Long, I’m a 
                rising sophomore at Virginia Tech pursuing a major in Computer Science.  
                I am currently deciding on if I would like to be on track for a minor in 
                Mathematics, Cyber Security, or Japanese.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br />I am Japanese American and have lived in Virginia for most of my life.  
                I have enjoyed playing soccer, surfing, watching movies, reading Si-Fi novels, 
                reading/watching LOTR, learning about quantum physics, playing video games, 
                making video games, and coding in general.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br />I started coding in python in my freshman year of high school for a project 
                I had to complete for my Middle Years Program, a pre-program to International 
                Baccalaureate (IB).  I created a text-based game that asked players to input either 
                jump or duck to get through an obstacle course.  Since then coding has only become 
                more and more exciting to me and can’t wait to continue to learn at college and 
                in my professional experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br />This website has been entirely coded up by myself using HTML5 and CSS.  
                Images are from in-game screenshots I took in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> ’s photomode.  
                Feel free to check out my resume page for a view of my skill allocations and 
                my projects page to see my past and current projects.
